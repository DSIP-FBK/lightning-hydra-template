# Better-Lightning-Hydra

_Suggestions are always welcome!_

</div>

This is my fork of [Lightning-Hydra-Template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template). The README over there contains much more detail.

The last commit to that repo was more than 2 years ago, and so it is a bit outdated.

Improvements I've made:

- Use `uv` as the package manager. [Install uv here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Everything is formatted with `ruff`. [Ruff docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- The tests actually work and pass (they have since been removed)
- Remove unneccessary files/configs that aren't applicable to our use case
