# Better-Lightning-Hydra

_Suggestions are always welcome!_

</div>

This is my fork of [Lightning-Hydra-Template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template). You can go read the README over there for all the details.

The last commit to that repo was like 2 years ago ☠️

Improvements I've made:

- Use `uv` like God intended
- Everything is formatted with `ruff` as Mary wanted
- The tests actually work and pass (the tests are now gone cuz ain't nobody got time fo dat)
- Remove some unneccessary files/configs ~~I don't~~ we don't use
